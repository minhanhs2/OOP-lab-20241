? What happens if the Aims class is not updated to handle exceptions when the play() method is called? 

When an exception occurs and isn't handled, it will "propagate" up through the layers of the program until it encounters a `try-catch` block or reaches the `main()` function. If the `main()` function also doesn't handle this exception, the program will terminate abruptly and display error information on the screen. This makes the program less robust and harder to use.
